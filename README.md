# Fine-Tune-BERT-for-Text-Classification-with-TensorFlow
This project on fine-tuning a Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT) model for text classification with TensorFlow. This project is the comprises of preprocess and tokenization of data for BERT classification, it also includes building TensorFlow input pipelines for text data with the tf.data API, and training and evaluating a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification with TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub.
